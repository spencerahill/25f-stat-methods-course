# Lecture notes and slides
## Web-hosted lecture notes
The lecture notes for this course are in the process of being published as a standalone, free, online, executable book.  The resulting material is intended to be useful to students and educators everywhere, not just students enrolled in this class this term.

For that reason, those live in their own, separate website [here](https://spencerahill.github.io/stat-methods-book), with their code in a corresponding Github repository [here](https://github.com/spencerahill/stat-methods-book).

(In case you're interested, both websites are created using [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/).
