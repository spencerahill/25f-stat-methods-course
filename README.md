# Fall 2025 CCNY EAS 42000/A42000

This is the Github repository for the public-facing website for this course, "Statistical Methods in Earth and Atmospheric Sciences," taught Fall 2025 at the City College of New York.

# For students this term: there are 3 relevant websites for you 
## 1. Go to [this link](https://spencerahill.github.io/25f-stat-methods-course/home.html) to visit the rendered public website itself.
The repository you're viewing right now is where the source code lives from which the published website gets built.  If you just want to, for example, check the class schedule, you should check it out on the published website.

This repository is where you can create [Issues](https://github.com/spencerahill/25f-stat-methods-course/issues) and [Pull Requests](https://github.com/spencerahill/25f-stat-methods-course/pulls), and contribute to the [Wiki](https://github.com/spencerahill/25f-stat-methods-course/wiki). 

## 2. Go to the course Brightspace site for non-public content
Such as grades, HW submission links, etc.

## 3. The lecture notes are housed in [their own repo](https://github.com/spencerahill/stat-methods-book) and published at [this link](https://spencerahill.github.io/stat-methods-book)
Go straight to their published site if you just want to use the notes for your learning.  Go to the repo if you want to see "under the hood" or create Issues or Pull Requests that relate to the lecture notes.

(This is a separate repo because the lecture notes are meant to be reused across classes.) 

# If you're not a student in this class this term, you probably want the lecture notes which are in [their own repository](https://github.com/spencerahill/stat-methods-book)

Those lecture notes are meant to be more generally useful to other students and instructors.  Although be advised they remain under active construction.
