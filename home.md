# Fall 2025, CCNY EAS 42000/A4200: Statistical Methods/Quantitative Data Analysis in Earth and Atmospheric Science

*Equipping students with (1) a toolbox of powerful data analysis tools, and (2) understanding of when and how to use them effectively.*

## What is this?
Welcome to this website for the Fall 2025 iteration of EAS 42000/A4200 at the [The City College of New York](https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/) (CCNY), taught by Prof. [Spencer Hill](https://shill.ccny.cuny.edu/), in the [Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences](https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/eas) (EAS).  On this site, you will find the course syllabus, class schedule, links to helpful external resources, and, as they come up in the semester, links to assignments and the final project.

The course is open to CCNY undergraduate students in EAS and other departments (as EAS 42000), EAS Masters students (as EAS A4200), and to PhD students in the [City *University* of New York](https://www.cuny.edu/) [Graduate Center](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/) [Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/earth-and-environmental-sciences) (as EES 79903-45781).  For both Masters and PhD students, the official course title replaces "Stastical Methods" with "Quantitative Data Analysis."

## This site is just for students taking the class with me this term!
Although this is a public website, and the underlying code lives in a public, open-access repository on Github, the materials here are 

There is a sister repo which houses the online, interactive, work-in-progress textbook associated with this course.  The materials there are meant to be useful to others as well, not just my students at CCNY this particular semester. 

## What can I do with this site?
If you're anything other than a student currently enrolled in the course that I am teaching at CCNY, you are free to modify any of these materials however you see fit.  And I encourage you to suggest any changes or improvements---or even submit a pull request that would implement them---to the Github repository where they live, which you can access via [this link](https://github.com/spencerahill/stat-methods-course) or via the ["Octocat"](https://octodex.github.com/original/) silhouette logo at the top of this page.
