# Instructions for HW self-grading and corrections

## Overview
In this class, you grade your own homework assignments.  After each submission deadline, a key is posted, and then you compare what you submitted to the key.  Based on that comparison, you submit to the professor what you believe is the appropriate grade, along with an explanation of any mistakes that you made and how you would correct them.

## Motivations
### LLMs
One is ChatGPT and other Large Language Models (LLMs).  The reality is that these generative AI tools have gotten so smart that they can, properly prompted, correctly solve virtually any question on any assignment that you will get in this class.  That includes both conceptual questions and coding-based ones.  Since completing the HW assignments on time contributes to your semester grade, this entices many students to simply copy-paste the HW prompts into the LLMs, then copy-paste back in their answers.  This results in full completion of the assignment and zero actual learning.

Having you grade your own submitted assignments and to submit corrections forces you to revisit what it is that you submitted (whether or not it came from your brain in the first place), compare it to the correct solution, and to the extent that it is incorrect, reflect on where it went astray (again, whether or not you actually generated it).

Even this is not LLM-proof: it's possible to paste in these instructions, the key, and your submission, and have the LLM do the grading and corrections for you well.  In that case, all I can say is: I feel sorry for you.

### Instructor time and timely feedback
Two others are instructor time and timely feedback.  Alas, your professor does not have enough time to properly grade each student's homework assignment in a timely fashion.  Self grading saves your professor time and also avoids the scenario where you're waiting weeks to get grades back.

### Spaced repetition
Another is *spaced repetition*.  A well-established result from cognitive science is that learning a topic goes better when you review the material at spaced intervals in time, rather than just seeing it once followed by a massive cram of all the topics just before an exam.  By having HW due dates one week after the class session on that material, followed by the self-grading and corrections due a week later, you engage with the material more in total and over a longer duration than you would otherwise. 

## Instructions
### Grading
For each question, compare what you submitted to what the answer key provides.

In terms of point values, simply treat each distinct element of each problem as worth one point.  Adding all of these distinct elements across all problems gives you the total points possible.  For each of these distinct elements, evaluate fairly whether you got it correct (1 point), incorrect or didn't do it (0 points), or substantially but not completely correct (0.5 points).  Sum these up, and divide by the total possible, to get your percentage score.

For open-ended questions, do not get bogged down in the details.  It's fine if you didn't format your plots the exact same way, or if your interpretation is different than the one provided by the key.  Just use reasonable judgment of whether your approach was reasonable, scientifically and mathematically justified, and articulated/displayed sufficiently well.

In all of this, the watchword (watch-phrase?) is *good-faith*.  Make a good-faith attempt at the assignment in the first place, followed by a good-faith evaluation of what you got right and what you did not.

All assignments carry the same weight for your grade, irrespective of their number of raw points.  As such, it's only meaningful to compare percentage scores, not raw point totals, across assignments.

### Corrections
For each element that you did not get 100% correct, you will write an explanation of what you did that was incorrect.  You will compile these all into a standalone document.

Starting with HW07, you will not receive *any* credit for the assignment if you do not complete this corrections component.

### Submission
For each HW assignment, when the answer key gets posted, there will also be posted a link for where you submit your self-graded score along with your corrections.  The due date for submitting these scores and corrections will be posted at the same time.

## Special instructions for Fall 2025
These instructions were posted late in the semester, after the due dates for HWs 01 through 06.  For all five of those assignments, there will be one single Google Form where you'll submit your corrections and grade for each.  (HW00 was purely completion-based.) 

**For HW01 through HW06, there is one single form, available [here](https://forms.gle/aSu9z5Xg11cxHGzN8).  Submit the form once per assignment.**

**For HW01 through HW06 only, because of the delay in providing these self-grading and correction instructions, the corrections are *optional* and will earn you 10% extra credit.  For subsequent assignments the corrections will be *mandatory*, and you will not receive any credit for the assignment without them.**
